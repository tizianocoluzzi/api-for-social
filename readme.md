### The pourpose is learning how to build an api for a generic social media using mongoDb EspressJs an NodeJs, I'm using npm as a package manager, I'm trying to learn how to use JWT for Authentication and Authorization

### About the frontend part i've no idea about the frameworks and libraries i'm going to use, I think I'll build the frontend part without focusing on aesthetic but to learn how to use call an api and interact with server
